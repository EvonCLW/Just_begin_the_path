# Theorem-Pythagoras
A simple project for the 'Computer Programming' subject. It can be used for calculation based on Pythagoras Theorem. 

## Define the Types of Triangle

![alt text](https://github.com/EvonCLW/Theorem-Pythagoras/blob/master/Types%20of%20triangle.png)

The triangle will be defined through the input (value of sides) given by the user.

## Calculation for Hypotenuse

![alt text](https://github.com/EvonCLW/Theorem-Pythagoras/blob/master/function%20of%20Theorem%20Pythagoras.png)

This program allow user to input two values, a and b. The values will be converted into float and th value of c will be calculated in 2 decimal places. 

## Calculation for the Value of Triangle' Sides

It contains 3 types of calculations:
If the user input 2 legs information of a right triangle, then the hypotenuse value will display.
If the user inputs the hypotenuse value and 1 leg value of a right triangle, than leg 2 value will display.
If it is not a right triangle, it will display the 'Pythagorean Theorem cannot be used'.

## Calculation of Area and Perimeter 

![alt text](https://github.com/EvonCLW/Theorem-Pythagoras/blob/master/geometry%20function.png)

This program allow user to calculate Area or Perimeter for different geometry. 

### Example 

The user is required to key in a number that represent a specific gometry [1=Square, 2=Rectange, 3=Triangle, 4=Equilateral Triangle, 5=Parallelogram, 6=Trapezoid, 7=Circle], follow by the value/s of side/s.
